# Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) - Learning & Implementation Journal

This repository documents my in-depth study of Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), aimed at building a solid foundation for my Master's thesis research. This log tracks the entire journey, from core theoretical concepts and key academic papers to hands-on implementation using Python for data analysis and model discovery.

Learning Objectives
To gain a deep understanding of OCPM's core theory, especially how it resolves the convergence and divergence issues inherent in traditional, case-centric process mining.   

To achieve proficiency in applying core Python libraries like pm4py and ocpa for OCPM analysis.   

To conduct an end-to-end analysis (discovery, conformance, performance) on a real-world dataset.
   
To explore potential research directions and develop a prototype for my final Master's thesis.

Learning Plan
This learning journey follows the guidance provided by my supervisor, structured in the following phases:

Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge
[ ] Read the OCEL 2.0 standard specification.

[ ] Explore the ecosystem of OCPM tools (e.g., PM4Py, OCPA).   

[ ] Study the fundamentals of PQL (Process Query Language).

Phase 2: Core Paper Review
[ ] van der Aalst, W. M. (2019). Object-centric process mining: dealing with divergence and convergence in event data.   

[ ] van der Aalst, W. M., & Berti, A. (2020). Discovering object-centric petri nets.   

[ ] Liss, L., Mensing, C., & van der Aalst, W. M. (2025). Object-Centric Causal Nets.   

Phase 3: Hands-on Implementation
[ ] Replicate core concepts and algorithms from the papers in Jupyter Notebooks.

[ ] Perform a full OCPM analysis on the related dataset.   

[ ] Conduct an exploratory analysis on other relevant datasets.
